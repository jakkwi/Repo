A game similar to Dofus, but in 3D and with roguelike elements.

I followed several tutorials to create this prototype, with the main one being Alex Quevillonâ€™s tutorial on YouTube.



Supported Unreal Engine Version: UE 5.6



Inputs:

&nbsp;	Mouse: Execute actions (left \& right click) and zoom (wheel)

&nbsp;	Keyboard: Camera movement (W, A, S, D, Q \& E)



Technical details:

&nbsp;	Done (works without problems, place for improvement):

&nbsp;		Top down camera movement

&nbsp;		Turn-based tactical combat

&nbsp;		Dynamic grid (Square, Hexagon and Triangle)

&nbsp;		Grid based pathfinding

&nbsp;		Basic tactical AI

&nbsp;		Overworld navigation

&nbsp;		In game debug menu to test all the features

&nbsp;		Player actions system to execute all kinds of actions by 			only using the left and right mouse buttons

&nbsp;		Multiple example of unit types, spells, AIs and levels

&nbsp;	To Do (started, in progress, working but not perfectly):

&nbsp;		Random Map Generation

&nbsp;		Random Enemy Generation

&nbsp;		Level System

&nbsp;		Character Class System

&nbsp;		Equipment System

&nbsp;		Rogue Like System (infinite levels)
