# \#Turnament (name in progress)

\##A game similar to Dofus, but in 3D and with roguelike elements.

I followed several tutorials to create this prototype, with the main one being Alex Quevillon’s tutorial on YouTube.

\##Inputs:

* Mouse: Execute actions (left \& right click) and zoom (wheel)

\##Technical details:

* Done (works without problems, place for improvement):

&nbsp;	- Top down camera movement

 	- Turn-based tactical combat

 	- Dynamic grid (Square, Hexagon and Triangle)

 	- Grid based pathfinding

 	- Basic tactical AI

 	- Overworld navigation

 	- In game debug menu to test all the features

 	- Player actions system to execute all kinds of actions by 		  only using the left and right mouse buttons

 	- Multiple example of unit types, spells, AIs and levels

* To Do (started, in progress, working but not perfectly):

 	- Random Map Generation

 	- Random Enemy Generation

 	- Level System
